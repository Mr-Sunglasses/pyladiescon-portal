                <p>
                    As a team lead, you may need to handle the following offboarding tasks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Remove access to team-specific resources, tools, or platforms
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Revoke permissions for team channels, documents, or repositories
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Redistribute any assigned tasks or responsibilities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Update team documentation and contact lists
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Remove from team-specific communication channels (Slack, Discord, etc.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                The volunteer has been automatically removed from the {{ team.short_name }} team in our system, and their application status has been set to "Cancelled".
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have any questions or need assistance with the offboarding process, please reach out to the admin team.
