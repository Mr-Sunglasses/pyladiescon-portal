Dear Team Lead,

This email is to inform you that a member of your team has cancelled their volunteer application.

Volunteer Details:

OFFBOARDING TASKS
As a team lead, you may need to handle the following offboarding tasks:
- Remove access to team-specific resources, tools, or platforms
- Revoke permissions for team channels, documents, or repositories
- Redistribute any assigned tasks or responsibilities
- Update team documentation and contact lists
- Remove from team-specific communication channels (Slack, Discord, etc.)

The volunteer has been automatically removed from the {{ team.short_name }} team in our system, and their application status has been set to "Cancelled".

If you have any questions or need assistance with the offboarding process, please reach out to the admin team.

Best regards,
The PyLadiesCon Admin Team
